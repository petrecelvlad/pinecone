# Claude Companion

You are a Claude agent working on this project. Read this immediately after `AGENT.md`. This is your provider-specific onboarding — it makes you effective in one pass.

## Onboarding Sequence

Read in this order. Each step gives you a specific capability:

1. `AGENT.md` (already read) — Constitution: phases, guardrails, standing rules.
2. `cone/PHILOSOPHY.md` — Framework philosophy: what this system is and why it exists.
3. `cone/agent/onboarding/START_HERE.md` — Framework orientation: what to read next and why.
4. `cone/agent/onboarding/CODING_COMPANION.md` — Coding standards: naming, functions, errors, types.
5. `cone/project/architecture/OVERVIEW.md` — System architecture: what was built and why.
6. `cone/agent/personas/COMMUNICATOR.md` — Always-active communication persona. Adopt immediately.

If you are about to write or modify code, also read:
7. `cone/agent/personas/DEVELOPER.md` — Developer persona. Adopt for all coding sessions.

## Session Protocol

One conversation = one session file. Sessions serve dual purpose: live tracking during work AND permanent archive after.

**Full protocol:** Read `cone/agent/onboarding/SESSIONS.md` before creating any session file.

**Quick reference:**
- **Location:** `cone/agent/sessions/MM_Month/Week_N/YYYY-MM-DD/`
- **File format:** `NN_SEMANTIC_TITLE.md` — NN is a global counter, title is 2-4 words
- **Template:** Copy `cone/agent/sessions/SESSION_TEMPLATE.md`
- **Before creating:** Check for `IN-PROGRESS` or `HANDOFF` status in recent sessions — continue from them, don't start fresh
- **Statuses:** `PLANNING` → `IN-PROGRESS` → `COMPLETE ✅` or `HANDOFF ✋`
- **Never delete** session files — they are the project's permanent history

## Memory Rules

### What to save (in `cone/project/memory/`)

Save if ALL are true:
- It's a behavioral correction or confirmed practice
- The WHY is non-obvious and not derivable from the code or docs
- It applies across multiple future sessions

### What NOT to save

- Implementation state, version numbers, feature status
- Anything derivable by reading the code or git history
- Session-specific context (that goes in session files)
- Solutions to bugs (the fix is in the code; the commit message has context)

### Where to save

| What | Where |
|---|---|
| A mistake with a non-obvious root cause | `cone/project/memory/ANTI_PATTERNS.md` |
| A practice confirmed to work well | `cone/project/memory/LESSONS.md` |
| A known failure mode with a fix | `cone/project/memory/PLAYBOOK.md` |

## Non-Obvious Pointers

<!-- CUSTOMIZE: Add project-specific pointers that save agents time. Examples: -->
<!-- - "The auth token is validated in middleware/auth.ts, not in individual routes" -->
<!-- - "Environment detection lives in utils/env.ts — never hardcode URLs" -->
<!-- - "The database schema is the source of truth, not the TypeScript types" -->

*Add project-specific navigation hints here as you discover them.*

## Creating a Companion for Another Provider

To create `GEMINI.md`, `COPILOT.md`, or any other provider companion:

1. Copy this file's structure (Onboarding Sequence, Session Protocol, Memory Rules)
2. Adapt the onboarding sequence to the provider's capabilities
3. Adjust memory rules to match the provider's context management
4. Keep the session protocol identical — it's provider-agnostic
5. Register the new companion in `AGENT.md` under "Agent-Specific Companion Files"
