  Skills index. Read to understand what skills are available and when to use them.
  A skill is a procedural workflow — it tells you HOW to do something.
  A persona tells you HOW to think.

# Skills

Skills are reusable procedural workflows — structured instructions for recurring tasks. An agent reads a skill's `SKILL.md`, follows the process, and produces consistent, high-quality output.

## Available Skills

| Skill | Purpose | Invoke when |
|---|---|---|
| [skill-creator](skill-creator/SKILL.md) | Create new skills or improve existing ones | "create a skill", "turn this into a skill", "improve this skill" |
| [evolution](evolution/SKILL.md) | Audit the framework and propose improvements | "improve the framework", "audit the docs", "what's missing from cone", "evolve the documentation" |

## When to Add a New Skill

A new skill is warranted when:
- The same multi-step process has been executed 2+ times
- The steps are stable (not experimental)
- The process would take a new agent more than 30 minutes to figure out independently
- An agent keeps making the same mistakes on a task type

A skill is NOT needed for:
- One-off tasks
- Tasks that vary too much to generalize
- Tasks so simple the agent handles them well without guidance

## Skill Anatomy

```
skill-name/
├── SKILL.md          ← Required. The agent reads this.
├── references/       ← Optional. Supporting docs loaded as needed.
│   ├── schema.md
│   └── examples.md
└── evals/            ← Optional. Test cases for the skill.
    └── evals.json
```

**`SKILL.md`** has two parts:
1. **Frontmatter** (YAML) — name, description, trigger phrases
2. **Body** (Markdown) — the actual instructions, steps, rules, output formats

Keep `SKILL.md` under ~500 lines. If it grows beyond that, move supporting material into `references/`.

## Persona vs Skill Reminder

| Dimension | Persona | Skill |
|---|---|---|
| Answers | "How do I think as X?" | "How do I do X?" |
| Contains | Mental models, heuristics | Steps, procedures, checklists |
| Persists | Duration of role context | Duration of task |

They compose. An Architect persona shapes how I think while an architecture-review skill guides what I do.
