# OKF Migration Guide for Hive OS

This document tells you everything you need to apply the OKF migration to the Hive OS project. It was written after successfully completing this migration on the cone-lite framework. Follow it as a playbook.

---

## What Changed and Why

The cone-lite project had a single metadata system called **Propolis** — `@propolis` JSON blocks in comments on every file, including markdown. This created a problem: markdown already has a native metadata format (YAML frontmatter), and wrapping JSON inside a JS comment inside a markdown file was a workaround.

**Open Knowledge Format (OKF)** is a Google-published spec (v0.1, June 2026) that standardizes YAML frontmatter for markdown-based knowledge systems. It gives us:
- A standardized schema (only `type` is required, everything else is optional/extensible)
- A static HTML visualizer that renders the knowledge graph with zero backend
- Interoperability with any OKF-compliant tool or agent

**The new standard is:**
- **Markdown files** in the knowledge bundle (`cone/` directory) → **OKF YAML frontmatter**
- **Source code files** (`.ts`, `.py`, `.rs`, etc.) → **@propolis JSON blocks** (unchanged)

Propolis is not removed. It is scoped to code files only. OKF handles the documentation layer.

---

## The OKF Spec in 30 Seconds

A conformant OKF bundle requires:
1. Every non-reserved `.md` file has YAML frontmatter with a `type` field
2. Reserved files are `index.md` (directory listing, no frontmatter) and `log.md` (change history)
3. Cross-references use standard markdown links — the graph is built from link traversal

Recommended optional fields: `title`, `description`, `resource`, `tags`, `timestamp`

Extension fields (any additional keys) are explicitly allowed. We use: `constraints`, `agent_instructions`, `always_active`, `scope`.

## Phase 1: Audit the Current State

Before migrating, understand what you're working with.

### 1.1 Find all markdown files in the knowledge bundle
```bash
find cone -name "*.md" | sort
```

### 1.2 Identify which files have @propolis blocks
```bash
grep -rl "@propolis" cone/ --include="*.md"
```

### 1.3 Identify which files already have YAML frontmatter
```bash
grep -rl "^---" cone/ --include="*.md"
```

### 1.4 Check for files with BOTH (these need merging)
Files that have both YAML frontmatter AND @propolis blocks need their metadata merged into a single OKF frontmatter block.

---

## Phase 2: Migrate Markdown Files

For each markdown file in the knowledge bundle:

### Pattern A: @propolis only (no existing frontmatter)

**Before:**
```markdown
/**
 * @propolis
 * {
 *   "role": "PROTOCOL",
 *   "constraints": ["Some constraint"],
 *   "agent_instructions": "Some instructions"
 * }
 */

# Document Title
```

**After:**
```markdown
---
type: Protocol
title: Document Title
description: One-line summary of what this document is.
tags: [relevant, tags]
timestamp: 2026-06-24T00:00:00Z
constraints:
  - Some constraint
agent_instructions: >
  Some instructions
---

# Document Title
```

**Steps:**
1. Map `role` → `type` (SCREAMING_CASE → Title Case: `PROTOCOL` → `Protocol`, `PERSONA` → `Persona`, etc.)
2. Derive `title` from the `# H1` heading
3. Write a one-line `description`
4. Add `tags` based on content/location
5. Set `timestamp` to today
6. Move `constraints` and `agent_instructions` into the frontmatter as extension fields
7. Remove the entire `/** @propolis ... */` block

### Pattern B: YAML frontmatter + @propolis (both present)

**Before:**
```markdown
---
name: some-name
archetype: Some Archetype
description: >
  Some description
always_active: true
scope: universal
---

/**
 * @propolis
 * {
 *   "role": "PERSONA",
 *   "agent_instructions": "Some instructions"
 * }
 */

# Title
```

**After:**
```markdown
---
type: Persona
title: Title
description: >
  Some description
tags: [relevant, tags]
timestamp: 2026-06-24T00:00:00Z
always_active: true
scope: universal
agent_instructions: >
  Some instructions
---

# Title
```

**Steps:**
1. Merge both blocks into a single OKF-compliant frontmatter
2. Drop `name` (OKF derives concept ID from file path)
3. Drop `archetype` (redundant with `type` + `title`)
4. Map `role` → `type`
5. Keep all other fields as extensions
6. Remove the @propolis block entirely

### Type Mapping Reference

| Old Propolis Role | New OKF Type |
|---|---|
| `BOOTLOADER` | `Bootloader` |
| `PROTOCOL` | `Protocol` |
| `PERSONA` | `Persona` |
| `SKILL` | `Skill` |
| `CONSTRAINT_REGISTRY` | `Constraint Registry` |

Add new types as needed: `Architecture`, `Reference`, `Template`, `Playbook`, `Lessons`, `Anti-Patterns`, `Evolution Proposal`, etc. OKF has no central registry — pick descriptive, self-explanatory names.

---

## Phase 3: Add Index Files

Add an `index.md` to every directory that has multiple files or subdirectories. Index files:
- Have **no frontmatter** (they're reserved files in OKF)
- List the directory contents with descriptions
- Enable progressive disclosure for agents and the visualizer

**Template:**
```markdown
# Directory Name

* [Document Title](FILENAME.md) - One-line description
* [Subdirectory](subdir/) - What's in there
```

---

## Phase 4: Normalize Cross-Links

The OKF visualizer builds graph edges from markdown links. Backtick-quoted paths (`cone/agent/onboarding/SESSIONS.md`) and bare text references don't register.

Convert cross-references to relative markdown links:

```
cone/agent/personas/COMMUNICATOR.md  →  [COMMUNICATOR.md](../personas/COMMUNICATOR.md)
Same directory:                      →  [SESSIONS.md](./SESSIONS.md)
Across pillars:                      →  [OVERVIEW.md](../../project/architecture/OVERVIEW.md)
```

**Don't convert:**
- References inside HTML comments (template instructions)
- References inside frontmatter `agent_instructions`
- References that are illustrative examples, not navigational

---

## Phase 5: Update Propolis Documentation

After the markdown migration, propolis is scoped to code files only. Update:

1. **PROPOLIS.md** — retitle to "Code File Metadata Standard". Add a scope disclaimer at the top: propolis is for code files, markdown uses OKF. Remove any "Documentation Roles" section from the role taxonomy (those are now OKF types, not propolis roles).

2. **AGENT.md** — update the metadata/propolis section to clarify the split: @propolis for code, OKF frontmatter for markdown in `cone/`.

3. **Any adoption guides** (START_NEW, APPLY_TO_EXISTING, etc.) — update references from "every file gets @propolis" to "every code file gets @propolis; markdown uses OKF frontmatter".

4. **Any persona/skill creators** — if they show @propolis block templates for markdown files, remove those. Personas and skills are markdown → OKF frontmatter.

---

## Phase 6: Install and Run the Visualizer

### Install
```bash
git clone https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/knowledge-catalog.git _tools/knowledge-catalog --depth 1
cd _tools/knowledge-catalog/okf
pip install -e .
```

Add `_tools/` to `.gitignore`.

### Generate
```bash
python -m reference_agent visualize --bundle cone --out cone_viz.html --name "your-project-name"
```

Add `cone_viz.html` to `.gitignore` (generated output).

### Add npm scripts
```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "lint:okf": "node scripts/lint-okf.js",
    "visualize": "python -m reference_agent visualize --bundle cone --out cone_viz.html --name your-project-name"
  }
}
```

---

## Phase 7: Add a Linter

Create `scripts/lint-okf.js` that:
1. Walks all `.md` files in `cone/`
2. Checks every non-reserved file has YAML frontmatter with a `type` field
3. Checks `index.md` files do NOT have frontmatter
4. Extracts markdown links (skipping fenced code blocks) and flags broken targets
5. Reports: `N concepts, X error(s), Y warning(s)`
6. Exits with code 1 if there are errors

You can copy the linter from the cone-lite project at `scripts/lint-okf.js`.

---

## Phase 8: Validate

Run this checklist after migration:

- [ ] `npm run lint:okf` → 0 errors, 0 warnings
- [ ] No `@propolis` blocks remain in any markdown file in `cone/`
- [ ] Every markdown file in `cone/` (except `index.md` and `log.md`) has YAML frontmatter with `type`
- [ ] Every `index.md` has no frontmatter
- [ ] `npm run visualize` generates a graph with edges (not just disconnected nodes)
- [ ] PROPOLIS.md says "code files only"
- [ ] AGENT.md clarifies the code/markdown metadata split
- [ ] All adoption guides reference both systems correctly
- [ ] No references to the old "propolis on markdown" pattern remain in active docs

---

## What NOT to Change

- **@propolis blocks in source code files** — leave these exactly as they are. OKF doesn't cover code.
- **The `@propolis` tag name and JSON format in code** — unchanged. The parser, the role taxonomy for code (SERVICE, PORT, ADAPTER, etc.), and the 3-field schema all stay.
- **Historical documents** (session files, proposals, ADRs) — don't retroactively migrate. They're archives. Add OKF frontmatter only if you need them to appear in the graph.
- **Files outside `cone/`** — AGENT.md, CLAUDE.md, README.md are entry points, not part of the OKF bundle. Don't add OKF frontmatter to them.

## Reference: The Design Decision

The full rationale for every design choice is in `cone/evolution/OKF/OKF_ADAPTATION.md` in the cone-lite project. Key decisions:

| Decision | Choice |
|---|---|
| Bundle boundary | `cone/` directory |
| Markdown metadata | OKF YAML frontmatter |
| Code metadata | @propolis JSON (unchanged) |
| Concept IDs | File path derived (no explicit `id` field) |
| Relationships | Untyped markdown links (no typed edge maps) |
| Type values | Title Case from propolis roles |
| Index files | New `index.md` alongside existing README.md |
| Visualizer | Google's OKF reference tool, unmodified |
